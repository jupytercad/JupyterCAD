JupyterCAD
==========

JupyterCAD is a JupyterLab extension for 3D geometry modeling with collaborative editing support. It is designed to
allow multiple people to work on the same file at the same time, and to facilitate discussion and collaboration around
the 3D shapes being created.

JupyterCAD has support for FreeCAD files, which makes it easy to import and export models from FreeCAD. It also has
a range of features for creating and manipulating 3D shapes, including a variety of primitives, transformations,
and Boolean operations.
