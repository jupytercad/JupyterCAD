Collaborative Features
======================

One of the standout features of JupyterCAD is its shared editing functionality, which **seamlessly connects users across different interfaces within the JupyterCAD ecosystem**. Whether collaborators are using the dedicated JupyterCAD application, the JupyterLab extension, or working with the Python API in a Notebook, **any changes made to a shared document are instantly reflected for all users**.

Follow Mode
===========

With JupyterCAD's follow-mode feature, collaboration becomes even more fluid. Follow another user's camera movements and view adjustments in real time.
You can follow another user, just **click on the other user icon in the JupyterCAD toolbar**:

Commenting System
=================

The commenting system in JupyterCAD adds an interactive layer to 3D designs. **Add comments directly to specific shapes within a CAD file**. Give context, feedback, or instructions.
This can be achieved by right clicking on 3D shapes:
